This is a placeholder file. In a real application, you would need to create actual icon files in various sizes as specified in the manifest.webmanifest file.

For a production app, you would need to create the following icon files:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

You can use tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate these icons from your app logo.
